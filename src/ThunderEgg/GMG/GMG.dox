/**
 * @namespace ThunderEgg::GMG
 * @brief Geometric-Multigrid classes.
 *
 * This namespace contains three abstract needed classes for multigrid cycles. Cycle, for which there
 * are implimentations for the V (VCycle), W (WCycle), and full multigrid (FMGCycle) cycles. Restrictor
 * restricts from a finer level in the multigrid cycle to a coarser level.
 * Interpolator interpolates from a finer level in the multigrid cycle
 * to a coarse level.
